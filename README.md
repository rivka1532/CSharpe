## 🛠️ Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK (latest version recommended)
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
- C# extension for VS Code (if using VS Code)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rivka1532/CSharpe.git
   cd CSharpe
   ```

2. Open with your preferred IDE:
   ```bash
   # Using Visual Studio Code
   code .
   
   # Or open .sln files in Visual Studio
   ```

3. Build and run projects:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

## 📚 Course Topics

### Fundamentals
- **Variables and Constants**: Different data types and their usage
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, logical, comparison, and assignment operators
- **Control Flow**: If-else statements, switch cases, loops (for, while, foreach)
- **Methods**: Function declaration, parameters, return types, overloading

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes and Objects**: Creating and instantiating classes
- **Properties and Fields**: Encapsulation and data hiding
- **Constructors**: Default and parameterized constructors
- **Inheritance**: Base classes, derived classes, method overriding
- **Interfaces**: Contract-based programming
- **Abstract Classes**: Abstract methods and classes

### Advanced Concepts
- **Collections**: List<T>, Dictionary<K,V>, Queue<T>, Stack<T>
- **Generics**: Type-safe collections and methods
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions and error handling strategies
- **File I/O**: StreamReader, StreamWriter, file operations
- **LINQ**: Query syntax and method syntax
- **Delegates and Events**: Callback methods and event handling
- **Lambda Expressions**: Anonymous functions and functional programming

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Code

Each project can be run independently:

```bash
# Navigate to specific project folder
cd ProjectName

# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

## 📝 Assignment Categories

- **Console Applications**: Command-line programs with user interaction
- **Class Libraries**: Reusable code components
- **File Processing**: Reading and writing data files
